    <p>Chess is a board game between two players. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it 
      from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The current form of the game emerged in Spain
       and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a similar but much 
       older game of Indian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.

      Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in
       an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two 
       knights, and eight pawns. The player controlling the white pieces moves first, followed by the player controlling the black 
       pieces. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") 
       and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
      
      Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (the International Chess 
      Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen 
      is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in
       chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art, and has connections with other fields such as 
       mathematics, computer science, and psychology.
      
      One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first 
      computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly 
      stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory.

      <h3>Indian <br>defence</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Indian Defence</p>
      <p>In the game of chess, Indian Defence or Indian Game is a broad term for a group<br> of openings characterised by the moves:<br>

        1. d4 Nf6[1]<br>
        They are all to varying degrees <br>hypermodern defences, where Black <br>invites White to establish an imposing presence in the 
        centre with the plan of undermining and ultimately destroying it.<br> Although the Indian defences were championed in the 1920s
         by players in the hypermodern school, they were not fully accepted until Russian players showed in <br>the late 1940s that these 
         systems are <br>sound for Black. <br>Since then, the Indian defences have <br>become a popular way for Black to <br>respond to 1.d4 because 
         they often<br> offer a balanced game with winning<br> chances for both sides. <br>Transpositions are important and<br> many variations can 
         be reached by <br>several move orders. <br>It is also possible to transpose<br> back into classical openings such <br>as the Queen's Gambit 
         and the <br>Slav Defence;<br> these are not considered "Indian" openings.</p>

      <h3>Two Knights <br>Defense</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Two Knights Defense</p>
      <p>The Two Knights Defense is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

        1. e4 e5
        2. Nf3 Nc6
        3. Bc4 Nf6
        First recorded by Giulio Cesare Polerio[1] (c. 1550 – c. 1610) in the late 16th century, this line of the Italian Game was 
        extensively developed in the 19th century. Black's third move is a more aggressive defense than the Giuoco Piano (3...Bc5).
         Black invites White to attack his f7-pawn with 4.Ng5. If White accepts the offer, the game quickly takes on a tactical 
         character: Black usually gives up a pawn for the initiative. The complications are such that David Bronstein suggested 
         that the term "defense" does not fit, and that the name "Chigorin Counterattack" would be more appropriate.[2] The Two
          Knights has been adopted as Black by many aggressive players including Mikhail Chigorin and Paul Keres, and world 
          champions Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky. In modern grandmaster play, 3.Bc4 is less common than 3.Bb5, and the more
           solid 3...Bc5 is the most frequent reply, so the Two Knights Defense is infrequently seen. It remains popular with
            amateur players. The theory of this opening has been explored extensively in correspondence chess by players such as 
            Hans Berliner and Yakov Estrin.</p>

      <h3>English<br> Opening</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">English Opening</p>
        <p>The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move:

        1. c4
        A flank opening, it is the fourth most popular[1][2] and, according to various databases, one of the four most successful 
        of White's twenty possible first moves.[1][3] White begins the fight for the centre by staking a claim to the d5-square from 
        the wing, in hypermodern style. Although many lines of the English have a distinct character, the opening is often used as a
         transpositional device in much the same way as 1.Nf3 – to avoid such highly regarded responses to 1.d4 as the Nimzo-Indian 
         and Grünfeld Defences — and is considered reliable and flexible.[4]
        
        The English derives <br>its name from the leading 19th century English master Howard Staunton, who <br>played it during his 1843 match
         with Saint-Amant and at London 1851, the first international tournament.[5] It did not <br>inspire Staunton's contemporaries and 
         <br>caught on only in the twentieth century.[5] <br>It is now recognised as a solid opening that may be used to reach both classical 
         and hypermodern positions. Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, and Magnus Carlsen have 
         employed it during their world championship matches. </p>

      <h3>Philidor<br> Defense</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Philidor Defense</p>
      <p>The Philidor Defence (or Philidor's Defence) is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

        1. e4 e5
        2. Nf3 d6
        The opening is named after the famous 18th-century player François-André Danican Philidor, who advocated it as an 
        alternative to the common 2...Nc6. His original idea was to challenge White's centre by the pawn thrust ...f7–f5.
        
        Today, the Philidor is known as a solid but passive choice for Black, and is seldom seen in top-level play except 
        as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good 
        opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex 
        positions that result from an opening such as the French Defence.
        
The main benefit of playing the Philidor Defense is that it makes it difficult for White to form a good attack right after the
 opening since Black has very little weaknesses.By using the d6 pawn to defend e5, Black will not have to support the e5 pawn with much else (like using a minor or major piece). This style of defense creates little weaknesses for Black.

 But, Black also blocks in his own bishop on f8 and accepts having to play in a cramped board position.
